How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs are best interpreted by having an open dialogue with the user.  By talking openly about what the user wants, you can interpret what is possible and deliverable.  Once you know what a user's wants and needs are, you can begin to implement them into a program by creating an architecture for the code.  User stories help with this, because they break down user requirements.  By naming different user stories you can identify different features, and manage them more successfully.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs by looking at the requirements, and then working through the process step by step.  When I reach a step where I realize I could have executed something better early on, I pause and return to improve functionality.  This is like agile because when I see something that could be a problem down the road, or a flaw in planning, I adapt and change.  By working in a more circular than linear fashion I am embracing an agile method.  I can incorporate sprints to make my programming flow better.  By doing things in small bits, addressing them, analyzing them, and then starting again I can improve my development work.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member is adding value without subtracting more resources than necessary.  Helping your team to address the problems set before you, and not monopolizing the process or creating more work for others.  A good team member pulls their weight, asks for help when they need it, and offers help to others.
